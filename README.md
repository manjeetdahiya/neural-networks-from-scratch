An academic numpy-based implementation of neural networks from scratch.
The library is capable of defining and training feed-forward neural networks and has been tested on datasets such as MNIST.
It includes a stochastic gradient descent optimizer, accuracy metrics, and a number of activation and loss functions. 
Two examples of using the library are also included.
